Current State:

2013/10/29
	Bluetooth pairing no longer needed!  Apparently a feature request does not require pairing
		-this does sometimes throw an odd socket error but the results seem valid

Older:
	Bluetooth scanning service works. We can scan for hosts and update a 
	file in /tmp with status. 

	Small web service to host /tmp file to master web server

	Master web service that will generate the where-are-you pages exists
        (looks damn good too)

ToDo:
	-Figure out if wireless (802.11) is a good method to scan too
	-Put the logic in for multiple Bluetooth radios scanning in parallel
	-XMPP bot
	-IRC bot
	-Make services for auto starting
	-Make front end web app more robust for when scanners are down

	-NFS boot/root setup?  

--------------
Design goals:

Highly Modular design.
	Intermodular dependancy will be low.  Everything can be standalone
		Not that it will always make sense, why host status info
		if you aren't scanning for fresh data?
	Currently planned modules:
		Bluetooth scanner (done)
		Status daemon (done)
		Master web page for in/out display (done)
		Management Interface

Multiple screens in communication with each other. (done)
	instead of "in" or "out" it can specify location
		"Emilio is IN Research Computing"
		"Paul is OUT"

Simple management interface
	Web pages are pretty.  Lets manage from that.  

Portability
	No Raspberry?  Who cares. "Linux" would be the main requirment

Secure(ish)
	Make it hard to man-in-the-middle or inject messages.
	Make it easy to opt-out/in
