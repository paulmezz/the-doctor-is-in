Some coworkers have a screen outside their office area which displays
which people are "in" or "out".  They have it plugged into a raspberry
pi with a bluetooth dongle which is paired to everyone's phones.

We are hoping to make a less "hacky" version of that code.  



Current State:
	Some base scripts exist.  We can scan for hosts and update a 
	file in /tmp with status

	Small web service to host /tmp file to master web server

	Began master web service that will generate the where-are-you pages

Design goals:

Highly Modular design.
	Intermodular dependancy will be low.  Everything can be standalone
		Not that it will always make sense, why host status info
		if you aren't scanning for fresh data?
	Currently planned modules:
		Bluetooth scanner
		Status daemon
		Master web page for in/out display
		Management Interface

Multiple screens in communication with each other.
	instead of "in" or "out" it can specify location
		"Emilio is IN Research Computing"
		"Paul is OUT"

Ease method of pairing devices.  
	Perhaps even sniffing wireless and just looking for a mac address
	Eventual goal of working with all phones.  iPhones seem to be picky

Simple management interface
	Web pages are pretty.  Lets manage from that.  

Portability
	No Raspberry?  Who cares. "Linux" would be the main requirment

Secure(ish)
	Make it hard to man-in-the-middle or inject messages.
	Make it easy to opt-out/in
